# IFTAS Connect Moderator Community Shared Vocabulary
Creating a common lexicon through translation helps decentralised social media moderators globally by fostering consistent understanding. This enhances communication, promotes fairness, and strengthens safety practices across communities, ensuring guidance is clear and culturally relevant.

The foundational shared vocabulary is based on the Digital Trust & Safety Partnership's Trust & Safety Glossary of Terms, available at https://dtspartnership.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DTSP_Trust-Safety-Glossary_July-2023.pdf 

DTSP graciously re-released the Glossary under a Creative Commons license, allowing IFTAS and the IFTAS Connect Community to build on this resource.
