Child Sexual Exploitation/Abuse Material (CSEA/CSAM)

Imagery or videos which show a person who is a child and engaged in or is depicted as being engaged in explicit sexual activity. Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (CSEA) is a broader category that encompasses both material depicting child sexual abuse, other sexualised content depicting children, and includes grooming.

"Simulated Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse Imagery" contains modified or invented depictions of children without the direct involvement of any underage subjects.

Experts, survivor groups, and the industry discourage the use of the term “Child Pornography,” which is still used as a legal term in multiple jurisdictions and international treaties.

CSAM is illegal in nearly all jurisdictions, making detection and removal of CSAM a high priority for online services.
