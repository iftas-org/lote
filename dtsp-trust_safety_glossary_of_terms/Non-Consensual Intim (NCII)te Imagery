Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery (NCII)

Non-consensual image sharing, or non-consensual intimate image sharing (also called "non-consensual explicit imagery" (NCEI) or colloquially called "revenge porn"), refers to the act or threat of creating, publishing or sharing an intimate image or video without the consent of the individuals visible in it.

What constitutes an intimate image will vary by cultural context. This could include nudity, private activity of various kinds, or showing someone without attire of religious or cultural significance the person would normally wear in public.

The imagery may have been created by or with the consent of the individuals shown, such as in the context of an intimate relationship, or created without consent through the use of hidden cameras or other surveillance methods.

Similarly, it may have been obtained with or without consent to possess it, or consent to possess it may have been revoked.

Sharing or distributing the content to others, without the depicted personâ€™s consent, is widely regarded as a form of harassment and is illegal in some jurisdictions. 

It should be noted that non-consensual intimate imagery is distinct from the unlicensed sharing of copyrighted, commercially-produced adult content.
