Glorification of Violence

Statements or images that celebrate past or hypothetical future acts of violence.

Some online services restrict or prohibit glorification of violence (including terrorism) on the reasoning that it may incite or intensify future acts of violence and foster a menacing or unsafe online environment, though it is challenging to distinguish glorification of a subject from other types of discussion of it.
