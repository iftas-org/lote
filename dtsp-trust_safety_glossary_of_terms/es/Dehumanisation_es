Dehumanisation

Describing people in ways that deny or diminish their humanity, such as comparing a given group to insects, animals or diseases.

Some experts in this area cite dehumanizing speech as a possible precursor to violence (sometimes to the point of genocide), because it may make violent action seem appropriate or justified against "nonhuman" or "less-than-human" targets.
