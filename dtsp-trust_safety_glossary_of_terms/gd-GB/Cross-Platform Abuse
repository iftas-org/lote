Instances where a bad actor or group will organize a campaign of abuse (such as harassment, trolling or disinformation) using multiple online services.

This has the effect of making it more difficult and time-consuming for affected persons to have the abusive content removed, as they will be required to contact each service separately and explain the situation.

Sometimes, the same content will simply be re-posted across multiple platforms. In other cases, bad actors will divide content or conduct such that no one service carries the full abusive content. As a result, lacking full context of the entire campaign, or if a service’s policy restricts its inquiry only to content or conduct that directly involves that service, a given service may determine that no violation has taken place.

Typically, such situations require research and integration of data from multiple services, and investigation of the background context of the bad actor(s) and affected person(s) to make more meaningful assessments and respond appropriately.
