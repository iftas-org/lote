Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior

Organized online activity where an account or groups of accounts including "fake" secondary accounts (which exist solely or mainly to engage in such campaigns) act to mislead people or fraudulently elevate the popularity or visibility of content or accounts, such as mass-following an account to raise its clout.

In some cases, a single, hidden source or organization will deploy many fake accounts in order to create a false appearance of authentic and credible activity.

In other cases, people using their own, real accounts will coordinate online to achieve a misleading purpose, such as the appearance that a view or belief is more widespread than it is, or to cause wide distribution of a particular piece or type of content.

Sometimes called "platform manipulation" or "content manipulation."
