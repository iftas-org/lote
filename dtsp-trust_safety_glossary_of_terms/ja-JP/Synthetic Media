Synthetic Media

Content which has been generated or manipulated to appear as though based on reality, when it is in fact artificial. Also referred to as manipulated media.

Synthetic media may sometimes (but not always) be generated through algorithmic processes (such as artificial intelligence or machine learning)

A deepfake is a form of synthetic media where an image or recording is altered to misrepresent someone doing or saying something that was not done or said.

Generally, synthetic or manipulated media (including "deepfakes"), may be used within the context of abuse to deceive or cause harm to persons, such as causing them to appear to say things they never said, or perform actions which they have not (as in the case of "Synthetic Non-Consensual Exploitative Images").

Synthetic media may also be used to depict events that have not happened.
