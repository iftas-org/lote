Defamation

A legal claim based on asserting something about a person that is shared with others and which causes harm to the reputation of the statementâ€™s subject (the legal elements and applicable defenses vary by jurisdiction).

Defamation can be conveyed through a range of media, including visually, orally, pictorially or by text.

In the United States, supported by First Amendment jurisprudence, the burden of proof to establish defamation is on the person alleging they have been defamed.

In other jurisdictions, such as Europe, the burden of proof may be on the defendant to establish they did not commit defamation.

These differences in legal approach and levels of associated legal risk may influence the takedown processes for defamation disputes adopted by online services in various localities.
