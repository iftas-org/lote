Georganiseerde aanval

Coordinated, often pre-planned, mass online activity to affect a piece of content, or an account, or an entire community or message board.

Examples include coordinated upvoting or downvoting a post to affect its distribution, mass-reporting an account (usually falsely) for abuse in an attempt to cause the service provider to suspend it, or inundating a business with good or bad reviews.
