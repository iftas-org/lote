Doxxing

The act of disclosing someone’s personal, non-public information — such as a real name, home address, phone number or any other data that could be used to identify the individual — in an online forum or other public place without the person’s consent.

Doxxing may lead to real world threats against the person whose information has been exposed, and for this reason it is often considered a form of online harassment.

Some services may also consider aggregating and disclosing publicly available information about a person in a menacing manner sufficient to constitute doxxing.
