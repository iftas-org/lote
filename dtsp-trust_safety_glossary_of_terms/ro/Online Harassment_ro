Online Harassment

Unsolicited repeated behavior against another person, usually with the intent to intimidate or cause emotional distress.

Online harassment may occur over many mediums (including email, social media, and other online services).

May expand to include real world abuse, or offline activity can transition online.

Online harassment may take the form of one abuser targeting a person or group with sustained negative contact, or it may take the form of many distinct individuals targeting an individual or group.
