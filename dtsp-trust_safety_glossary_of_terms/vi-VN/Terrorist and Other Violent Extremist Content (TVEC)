Terrorist and Other Violent Extremist Content (TVEC)

Content produced by or supportive of groups that identify as, or have been designated as terrorist or violent organizations, or content that promotes acts of terrorism or violent extremism.

There is no universally agreed international definition of terrorism or violent extremism and definitions for these terms vary significantly across jurisdictions.

Approaches to defining the category include actor- and behavior-based frameworks, and in order to detect and remove it, online services may rely on research and lists of terrorist or extremist organizations created by subject matter expert organizations, such as the United Nations Security Councilâ€™s sanctions list.

TVEC content is increasingly a focus of lawmakers and regulators concerned with preventing its availability.
